# Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease {.unnumbered}

This study identified new risk loci and implicated Aβ, tau, immunity and lipid
processing.

## Resuts

Genome-wide-significant associations:

- R47H *TREM2* coding variant: triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2.
  With its antiinflammatory role, the P47H mutation may affect the brain's
  ability to prevent the buildup of plaque.

- *ECHDC3*: may be part of fatty acid biosynthesis and insulin sensitivity

- *ACE*: aangiotensin-converting enzyme.

Suggestive association:

- *ADAM10*: stabilization and regulation of the molecular optimization of the
  glutamatergic synapse.

- *ADAMGS1*:

- *IQCK*:

- *ACE*
