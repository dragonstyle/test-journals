# When does Alzheimer's disease really start? The role of biomarkers

This paper reviews biomarkers and their usefullness at diagnosing AD. Since
biomarkers can do so before traditional clinical symptoms, the authors evaluate
when AD can be said to have started. They consider the disease one with a
gradual progression with different stages.

## AD biomarkers

### In cerebrospinal fluid

- Aβ42 and tau. Aβ is diminished in the CSF of patients with AD compared to
  healthy patients since it forms Aβ oligomers in the brain. An increase of tau
  in the CSF is a good predictor, while not specific to AD.

### Imaging biomarkers

- PiB-PET: a ligand of Aβ that allows analysis of Aβ load and spatial
  distribution when used in PET.
- FDG-PET: measures the cerebral metabolism of glucose and indicates neuronal
  and glial function. It correlates with decreased levels of synaptophysin that
  indicates a loss of synaptic activity.
- Structural and Functional MRI: cerebral atrophy can be quantified with MRI and
  be detected before the onset of clinical symptoms. It is considered a reliable
  diagnostic tool. It shows atrophy and thinning of the cerebral cortex.


## When AD starts

AD is an extended disease that with a latent start that progresses gradually
untli the patient's cognition is compromised. Dementia is the final stage rather
than the onset of the disease.

Increased levels of Aβ would lead to the formation of plaques and a reduction in
the levels of Aβ in the CSF - all while the patient is cognitively normal. Then
there would be in increase in CSF tau abnormalities. The final stage would show
cortical atrophy and decreased hippocampal volume that an MRI would detect.

## Risk factors in biomarker dynamics

People without APOE4 show an initial increase and then a decrease in CSF Aβ42
with a progression of CSF tau. Those with at least one APOE4 allele showed only
a decrease in CSF Aβ42 associated with a progression of tau pathology and then
both markers became positive with disease progression.

## New classification - A/T/N system

- A: β-amyloid marker - on the Alzheimer's continuum
- T: value of tau marker - have AD
- N: neurodegeneration or neuronal injury markers - have AD
