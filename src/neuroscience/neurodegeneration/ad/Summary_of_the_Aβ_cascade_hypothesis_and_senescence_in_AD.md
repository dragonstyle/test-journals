# Summary of the Aβ cascade hypothesis and senescence in AD

Senescence plays a major role in the onset of AD, but it is unclear whether it
plays a causative role or is a consequence of other cellular changes.

##Pathway to Senescence

Senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest that is induced by p21 in response to
DNA damage (tumorsuppressive) or a consequence of postmitotic neuronal cells
attempting to reenter the cell cycle.

Aβ oligomers are capable of inducing senescence in neurons. These are produced
when APP is cleaved in a way that releases an aggregation-prone variant. They
can appear 15 to 25 years before the onset clinical AD and once present,
removing them does not affect disease progression. It has been proposed that Aβ
triggers a cascade and that this cascade may be senescence. Aβ could be a a SIPS
inducer.

Once Aβ oligomers form, biomarker methods could be used to diagnose the patient
on the Alzheimer's spectrum.

## Senescence

Senescence in AD is characterized by the following phenotypes:

- arrest of the cell cycle and attempting reentry SASP with microglial
 
- overactivation and the release of inflammatory cytokines aggravating Aβ and
  tau pathology

- oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, telomeric damage aberrant
  phosphorylation of histones, changes in the methylation of critical genes

- altered proteostasis

Once senescent, the neuron can enter a stage of secondary senescence marked by
p26. This stage also involves the spread of senescent signals to neighbours and
induce senescence in them.
