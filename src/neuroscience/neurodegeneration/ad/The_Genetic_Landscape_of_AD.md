# The Genetic Landscape of Alzheimer's disease

## Amyloid precursor protein

In the amyloidogenic pathway, its proteolysis produces two variants of Aβ, one
of which is aggredation prone and is found in AD brain plaques.

## Presenilin 1 and 2

Mutations in these genes impair the γ-secretase mediated cleavage of APP. PSEN 1
mutations can have complete penetrance.

## Apolipoprotein E

*APOE* encodes for ApoE which is involved in neuronal growth, repair response to
injury, nerve regeneration, immunoregulation and activation of lipolytic
enzymes.

There are three major allelic variants with *APOE* ε4 increasing the risk of
both early and late onset AD. It does not cause the disease on its own.

## *TREM2*

*TREM2* codes for the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells and
increses risk for late onset AD. It's effect is comparable to that of *APOE*
but its frequency is low.
