# Cerebrovascular Senescence Is Associated With Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease

This paper examines the relationship between cerebrovascular senescence and
AD-related tau pathology. Vascular dysfunction is increasingly implicated in AD
pathogenesis. There is evidence to suggest that tau pathology may interact with
endothelial cell changes to drive vascular impairment in AD. Cellular senescence
and tau NFT formation have shown a positive feedback relationship and
suppression of senescence prevents tau aggregation. They examined whether
endothelial senescence contributes to microvascular alterations in tau-related
neurodegenerative disease using microvessels from the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex.  

## Results

They found upregulation of the senescence and leukocyte adhesion associated
genes that are also involved in DNA damage response signalling pathway that is
involved in cellular senescence.


They found that senescence associated genes are upregulated in B3 PFC
microvessels (2.5-fold increase in senescence-associated genes mRNA).

Of the 40 genes, 11 were significantly upregulated by at least a 2-fold average
increase in mRNA expression.

They did not find that plasma senescence-associated protein levels are
associated with postmortem severity of AD-related neuropathological changes.
