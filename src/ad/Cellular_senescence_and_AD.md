# Cellular senescence and Alzheimer disease: the egg and the chicken scenario

It is hard to know whether the accumulation of senescent cells is the cause or
result of AD-related disease.

- p53: controls the activation of pro-apoptotic regulators in response to cell
  damage
- p21: induce senescence to control milder damage p26: marks a further senescent
- stage; inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 leading to long-lasting arrest of the cell cycle

Senescence is helpful when there is an acute insult, but when the problem is
chronic, it can be cytotoxic.

If senescent cells are not cleared, they enter a stage called late senescene
which that is associated with neurodegeneration.  Senescent cells can spread
senescent signals to their neighbours and induce senescence - bystander effect.
This could account for how post-mitotic cells enter senescence.

Are any known or yet­to­be discovered genetic risk loci associated with AD involved in the senescence pathway?
