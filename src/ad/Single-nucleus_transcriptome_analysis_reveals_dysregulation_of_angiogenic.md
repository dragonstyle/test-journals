The authors profiled 169,496 nuclei from healthy and AD patient brains. They
found novel cell-type markers for astrocytes, endothelial cells, excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.
The proportion of endothelial cells was higher in their AD samples than in the
controls. Comparing the transcriptomic profiles, they found 2190 DEGs, 11 of
which were differentially expressed by all cell types. In general, they saw that
four pathways were dysregulated: angiogenesis in endothelial cells, immune
response in endothelial cells and microglia, decreased myelination in
oligodendrocytes and lowered synaptic signalling in astrocytes and neurons. They
found sub-population heterogeneity that contributes to this neuronal
dysfunction.When compared with bulk data, they could validate the changes they
saw, but the bulk data was not able to delineate changes between each cell-type.
They were able to do that validation with another single-nucleus RNA-seq paper
by Mathys et al., 2019.
